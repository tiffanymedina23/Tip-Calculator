Submitted by: **Tiffany Medina**

Time spent: 6 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [X] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [X] UI animations
* [X] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.

## Notes

This is my first project ever done in Swift or XCode. Prior to this I had no experience or knowledge of Swift and 
used the resources from CodePath as well as the Swift Tools Guide as resources to accomplish extra features such 
as design elements, splitting features, the settings page and adding an app icon. 

I decided to take a different approach on the UI aspect of the project than the examples shown to be able to stretch my
creativity from the norm and show my creativity with app development further. 

I enjoyed this project thoroughly and I hope I get the opportunity to learn about and extend my skill set of Swift with CodePath!
